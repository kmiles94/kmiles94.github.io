									<h2>Seattle Discards Web Map</h2>
								</header>
								<iframe width="100%" height="600px" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="mapbox.html"></iframe>

								<p><strong>Figure 1.2:</strong> This interactive web map displays 'show and hide layers' of Seattle's Sharps Discard Drop Boxes, along with discards that have been reported to the City of Seattle via their hotline since 2016. The data ends in early 2019. This map is meant to show how sharps discards in the public right of way have increase over the year. The installation of drop boxes is a pilot program Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) has put together to see if there is a reduction in discards in the future. If there is a reduction in discards, more drop boxes will be installed to neighborhoods that are affected the most. Please see Figure(s) 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 in the <a href="onecolumn.html">Neighborhoods</a> tab of this webpage to see what neighborhoods are most affected.
								</p>
							
								<p>Displaying the different show and hide layers allows the user to toggle between the different discard’s years, and the various drop box locations. When toggling through the different years, the user can see how the discards have increase in different neighborhoods over the years, and when showing the drop box layer, one can see how the discards have decreased around these points with increase accessibility. The hope with these drop boxes is that it will minimize discards throughout all neighborhoods in Seattle to ensure that harm reduction efforts, and best management practices are being utilized to their full effectiveness with these 24-hour drop boxes.</p>

								<h4>Analysis of Discard Locations, and Future Location of Drop Boxes</h4><br>

								<iframe width="100%" height="500px" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="All_Discards_Heatmap.html"></iframe>	

								<p><strong>Figure 1.3:</strong> This interactive Heatmap displays discards reported in the public right of way from 2016 to 2019. Areas with the highest density include Lake City in NorthEast Seattle, Ravenna in North Seattle, Old Ballard in North Seattle, Georgetown in South Seattle, Lower Queen Anne in Downtown Seattle, and East Queen Anne in Downtown Seattle. This heat map has helped to locate potential future drop boxes to approach discarded sharps hazards in this area.  
								</p>

								<br><br>

								<iframe width="100%" height="500px" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="ClusterMap.html"></iframe>
								<p><strong>Figure 1.4:</strong> This table represents the response rates from all surveys sent out on October 13th, 2017. The total amount of surveys sent out were 29,742. The total amount of surveys that were returned were 2,563. The areas that recieved the highest amount of surveys were Freeway Park (10,802), Fremont Canal Park (4,159), and Mineral Springs Park (3,844).
								</p>

								<iframe width="100%" height="500px" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="DropBox.html"></iframe>

								<p><strong>Figure 1.5:</strong> This interactive web map displays current drop box locations, as well as potential drop box locations. Based on the heatmap above, and reports of discards. The 6 potential discard boxes will exist in North Seattle, Downtown Seattle, and South Seattle. Since North Seattle has the highest density of points, meaning they have the most discards of all the Seattle neighborhoods, 3 of the 6 drop boxes will be placed in this area. In Northeast Seattle, Lake City will be gaining a dropbox near NE 125th Street and 33rd Ave NE. In North Seattle, Ravenna Park, near Ravenna BLVD and Cowen Pl NE and Marvin's Gardin in Old Ballard near 22nd AVE NW and Ballard AVE NW will recieve drop boxes as well. In Downtown Seattle, East Queen Anne near the Westlake Greenbelt on Westlake Ave N and 8th AVE N; and Lower Queen Anne on Queen Anne Ave N & Republican Street will also recieve drop boxes. There will be 1 drop box placed in South Seattle near Georgetown at Ruby Chow Park on S Albro Pl & 13th Ave S.</p>
