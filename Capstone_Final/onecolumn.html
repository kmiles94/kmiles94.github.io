									<h2>Neighborhoods affected by discards</h2>

								<p> 
									The chlorpleth maps below represent the level of risk each neighrbohood is at, based on current discard reports. The risk are categorized by Very Low, to Very High, which was used to identify what neighrborhoods have recieved the highest amount of discards since 2016. The levels of risk were created by percent, 0-5% of discards reported and located in that year would make a neighborhood at very low risk of discards, 5-15% is low risk, 15-25% is moderate risk, 25-50% is high risk, 50% and above is very high risk. Throughout the years, more than 50% of all discards in Seattle have been reported in the North Seattle neighborhood. The number of reported discards are also represented in the maps below as white dots.

								<p><strong>Figure 1.8:</strong> This data represented in this interactive map are the location of discards reported to Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) in 2016. This map does not represent all discards for 2016. however marks a special point in the Sharps Pilot Program by being the first data set to be collected in the project. These are not the number of discards total in 2016, how these 2016 points were the first to be reported to the SPU Hotline.

								<p><strong>Figure 1.9:</strong> This data represents the number of discards reported to SPU in 2017. There was a significant increase in sharps reports compared to the prior year. After SPU's Sharps Pilot Program arranged community outreach events and education events in early 2017, more people in the Seattle communities became familiar with the location of the drop boxes via flyers, and what the drop boxes were being used for. 
									<br><br>

								In 2017, the SPU Sharps Pilot program collected more than 32,000 needles. More than 27,000 sharps were collected through the 24-hour sharps drop boxes alone, and about 5,400 sharps were collected by SPU Field Crews. The Field Crews collect reported sharps within 24-hours of the complaint. This was also the first year surveys were sent out to residents who lived within a mile radius of each drop box asking questions about awareness of the drop boxes, and whether or not they noticed a difference in discards in their neighborhood (did they notice an increase/decrease). Based on the results Dr Jose Rizal Park found these drop boxes to be most useful to the neighborhood, and also had a large number of discard reports from this area.

								<p><strong>Figure 2.2:</strong> The data from Seattle was only collected through April. This is not a full data set, however you an see a continuous trend of where the discards are reported from the previous year. The highest amount of discards is from North Seattle, and the lowest in West Seattle.
