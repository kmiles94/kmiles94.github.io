								<p> <strong>Background: </strong><br>

								Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) department of Illegal Dumping saw the effects of injection drug usage through discarded sharps (needles, syringes, and lancets) in the public right of way. Complaints of discarded needles in public spaces continued to rise within the city. While many of these complaints are thought to be from illicit drug usage, some are likely from individuals who use needles for medical reasons. Feedback from Seattle residents via phone calls, e-mail, and the city’s mobile reporting app led to the start of the Sharps Collection Pilot Program.</p>

								<p> <strong> The Pilot Program: </strong><br>

								The Sharps Collection Pilot program, founded in 2016, has the goal of reducing the number of sharps (syringes, needles, lancets) in public spaces while increasing safety measures surrounding needle disposal. The pilot provides services in the form of six large outdoor sharps disposal boxes throughout the city, along with smaller disposal boxes located in comfort stations in three city parks. In addition, the pilot provides removal services for sharps found on public property within 24 hours. The sharps collection staff work comes from complaints from our website, phone calls via SPU Hotline. While these services are incredibly helpful for public property, the Sharps Collection staff does not pick up needles on private property. To help mitigate issues of improper needle disposal on private property, the pilot also provides baseline resources, education, and community trainings for customers on sharps cleanup. As of January 2, 2019, SPU has collected 17,940 sharps from complaints. A total of 137,449 sharps have been collected from the drop box locations since February of 2017. This amounts to a total of 155,389 sharps collected since the program’s inception. </p>

								<p> <strong> Program Goals: </strong><br>

								The goals of the program in 2018 were to continue to monitor the nine disposal box locations, respond to complaints within 24 hours, expand education and outreach efforts, and survey the community to identify public opinion. The team collected and organized data from complaints and from the drop boxes, monitored feedback from customers, organized education events, and conducted outreach in many Seattle neighborhoods. As the year went on, the education and outreach efforts expanded within SPU, as well as out in the community. A 2018 highlight for the Sharps program was the completion of a series of educational videos on the program.</p>

								<p><strong>Community Outreach Events:</strong><br>
									One of the goals for the 2018 year was to expand the pilot’s efforts in the realm of education and outreach. The Sharps Collection team aimed to expand these efforts, to help customers and employees feel more comfortable and be safe when dealing with needle litter. When conducting outreach, the team aimed to empower individuals with the necessary knowledge and resources to report needles, clean up needles on private property, and keep their communities safe. The Sharps Collection team did successfully expand the education and outreach aspect of the Program, with over 225 more people trained in 2018 than in 2017. A total of 40 outreach and education events were conducted by the Sharps Collection Team in 2018 with community organizations and SPU staff groups.  <br><br>

									Some of these outreach events included training sessions with flyers, formal presentations, and educational materials. Other efforts were solely tabling events, where the Sharps Collection Team provided flyers, sharps kits, and information on the city’s mobile reporting app. These events varied in size from 4 participants to 100 participants. In 2018, the program reached over 580 people total with outreach and education. At these trainings, 167 sharps collection kits were given out to community members, which will easily allow them to put their skills into practice if they find needles. <br><br>

									To aid with outreach and education events in the future, Sharps Collection staff created a set of informational videos. These videos serve as a base for in person trainings and are now available to the public via our website and SPU social media accounts. Not only do these videos provide a visual representation of our sharps disposal efforts, they create a lasting resource for communities to use in the future. A large portion of the work to create these videos was conducted in 2017. In the 2018 year, the program completed production and released the videos to the public. Key themes from the <a href="https://youtu.be/-y3zBmn74uE" target="blank">Sharps program overview video</a> are used to shape a series of three supplemental videos to target customer needs. These videos focus on safe sharps collection and disposal in <a href="https://youtu.be/ag8Mt0Em1Xk" target="blank">Business Improvement Areas</a> and through <a href="https://youtu.be/xt1iAWRlVrw" target="blank">community member involvement.</a> </p><br>

								<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>

									While other issues related to sharps (such as homelessness, addiction, and drug access) are beyond Seattle Public Utilities’ scope of work, the Sharps Collection Pilot services are part of a larger harm reduction approach throughout the City of Seattle. By keeping needles off the streets, the Pilot program keeps Seattle safe, and reduces the harmful effects that needles can have on individuals and on neighborhoods. <br><br> 

									One single method will not be enough to address the large issues of improperly disposed sharps. A myriad of strategies remains essential to address the issue. Sharps disposal boxes and responding to customer complaints are only a couple of ways that help reduce improper sharps disposal. As customers recognize that the city of Seattle is working to fix the problem, complaints in turn go down. Customers who are aware of the available resources and how to use them will become empowered to address the problem in their community.  Education, outreach, and communication with our Seattle communities must continue through a variety of outlets to help fix the complex problem of improper sharps disposal. These efforts and the continued hard work of the Sharps Collection Pilot team will reduce harm, save the city hours and money, and keep customers safe.</p>
