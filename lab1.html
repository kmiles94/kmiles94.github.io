			<h3>Beginning</h3>
			<p><h5> Starting a something new is not always as easy as it seems. Starting can sometimes be the biggest obstacle in moving forward with any new task. Sewing is something that takes a little more research when starting, because it involves an investment of your time and money. The goal of this website is the help those who are curious about sewing and want to explore it more, and beginners to find helpful tutorials, podcasts, and the essential tools to start.

			<h3>Research</h3>
			<p><h5> One of the most important steps to beginning a new journey, especially one that requires spending, is the research. Researching materials you need, where to find them (i.e. online, local shops, etc.) and how to use them properly. This website provides a base of research already done for you, including where to join local sewing classes, what materials to buy, and where to see, read, and listen to tutorials that can help you become a better craftsman.
