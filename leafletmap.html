            <h4><center>What is a CAFO, and why are they important:</center></h4>
            <h3><center> This interactive map displays the CAFOs per county in the United States. CAFOs are industrial sized livestock operations. There area several different types of CAFOs that house different animals, for various reasons (i.e. Dairy, Cattle, Pig, Chicken, Broiler, etc). This is where most grocery stores, restaurants, and fast food chains get their meat, dairy, and egg products. CAFOs not only have detrimental effects on animals, but also the environment. <a href="https://www.ewg.org/interactive-maps/troubleinfarmcountry/fertilizer.php"> Drinking water</a> and <a href="https://gispub.epa.gov/airnow/">air quality</a> are threatened in communities that surround CAFOs (click on 'air quality' or drinking water' to view interactive maps with pollution data surrounding CAFOs). When viewing the maps on contaminated drinking water, and air pollution, refer back to this interactive map to see that locations of the highest amount of pollution align with where there are 100+ CAFOs. North Carolina, Missouri, and California are the leaders in the amount of CAFOs per county, as well as with highest contaminated water and lowest air quality in the counties that havec the most CAFOs. </center>
          <hr>This map was create via LeafletJS library and includes data from Data.gov about the number of CAFO's per county, and state outlines. </h3>
