								<p> <strong>Background: </strong><br>

								Seattle Public Utilities (SPU) department of Illegal Dumping saw the effects of injection drug usage through discarded sharps (needles, syringes, and lancets) in the public right of way. Complaints of discarded needles in public spaces continued to rise within the city. While many of these complaints are thought to be from illicit drug usage, some are likely from individuals who use needles for medical reasons. Feedback from Seattle residents via phone calls, e-mail, and the city’s mobile reporting app led to the start of the Sharps Collection Pilot Program.</p>

								<p> <strong> The Pilot Program: </strong><br>

								The Sharps Collection Pilot program, founded in 2016, has the goal of reducing the number of sharps (syringes, needles, lancets) in public spaces while increasing safety measures surrounding needle disposal. The pilot provides services in the form of six large outdoor sharps disposal boxes throughout the city, along with smaller disposal boxes located in comfort stations in three city parks. In addition, the pilot provides removal services for sharps found on public property within 24 hours. The sharps collection staff work comes from complaints from our website, phone calls via SPU Hotline. While these services are incredibly helpful for public property, the Sharps Collection staff does not pick up needles on private property. To help mitigate issues of improper needle disposal on private property, the pilot also provides baseline resources, education, and community trainings for customers on sharps cleanup. As of January 2, 2019, SPU has collected 17,940 sharps from complaints. A total of 137,449 sharps have been collected from the drop box locations since February of 2017. This amounts to a total of 155,389 sharps collected since the program’s inception. </p>

								<p> <strong> Program Goals: </strong><br>

								The goals of the program in 2018 were to continue to monitor the nine disposal box locations, respond to complaints within 24 hours, expand education and outreach efforts, and survey the community to identify public opinion. The team collected and organized data from complaints and from the drop boxes, monitored feedback from customers, organized education events, and conducted outreach in many Seattle neighborhoods. As the year went on, the education and outreach efforts expanded within SPU, as well as out in the community. A 2018 highlight for the Sharps program was the completion of a series of educational videos on the program.</p>

								<p><strong>Figure 1.8:</strong> This interactive Heatmap displays discards reported in the public right of way from 2016 to 2019. Areas with the highest density include Lake City in NorthEast Seattle, Ravenna in North Seattle, Old Ballard in North Seattle, Georgetown in South Seattle, Lower Queen Anne in Downtown Seattle, and East Queen Anne in Downtown Seattle. This heat map has helped to locate potential future drop boxes to approach discarded sharps hazards in this area.

								<p><strong>Figure 1.9:</strong> This interactive web map displays current drop box locations, as well as potential drop box locations. Based on the heatmap above, and reports of discards. The 6 potential discard boxes will exist in North Seattle, Downtown Seattle, and South Seattle. Since North Seattle has the highest density of points, meaning they have the most discards of all the Seattle neighborhoods, 3 of the 6 drop boxes will be placed in this area. In Northeast Seattle, Lake City will be gaining a dropbox near NE 125th Street and 33rd Ave NE. In North Seattle, Ravenna Park, near Ravenna BLVD and Cowen Pl NE and Marvin's Gardin in Old Ballard near 22nd AVE NW and Ballard AVE NW will recieve drop boxes as well. In Downtown Seattle, East Queen Anne near the Westlake Greenbelt on Westlake Ave N and 8th AVE N; and Lower Queen Anne on Queen Anne Ave N & Republican Street will also recieve drop boxes. There will be 1 drop box placed in South Seattle near Georgetown at Ruby Chow Park on S Albro Pl & 13th Ave S.
