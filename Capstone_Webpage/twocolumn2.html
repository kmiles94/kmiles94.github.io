									<h2>Survey of Sharps Discards</h2>
								</header>
								<p><a href="https://arcg.is/1CuK1b" target="blank"> Click here to take Sharps Survey</a>

								<p>In October of 2017, SPU’s Sharps Collection Pilot sent out surveys by mail to nine Seattle neighborhoods. The purpose of the survey was to educate the neighborhood about the needle disposal boxes in their area, and to gain neighborhood opinions on the issue of needle disposal. We hoped to achieve a better understanding of public use and opinions surrounding the boxes, to better serve these communities. The following report will break down the responses we received back. </p>

								<p>A total of 7 questions were included in our survey, all multiple choice. The questions are listed below, and a sample of our survey can be found in the appendix. Participants were given a brief explanation of the program and the purpose of the survey, and were asked to choose one answer for each question. This report will break down the results overall, results of each question, and results of each neighborhood. We hope that this information will be utilized to further build upon the success of the Sharps Collection Pilot, and make changes to the program when necessary.<br>
								</p>

								<h3><strong> Results: </strong></h3><br>
								<p> A total of 29,742 homes, businesses, and apartment units received surveys. The survey area for each neighborhood was within a half a square mile of each box. The survey was sent out by mail on October 13th, 2017, and was left open through January 5th of 2018. A total of 2,563 responses were collected, with an 8.62% response rate. Because of variations in population density, certain neighborhoods received more surveys (refer to this table below in Figure 1.1). We were looking to gain all perspectives of residents and businesses throughout these nine neighborhoods. We decided to design our survey in this uneven way so that each sample we received back was representative of the neighborhood’s population density. For example, as shown below in Figure 1, 36% of our surveys were sent out to Freeway Park. Freeway Park is in the most densely populated neighborhood in the city, First Hill. Therefore, we sent out over 1/3 of our surveys there, to gain all perspectives of residents and businesses in the area. In contrast, Airport Way accounted for only 1% of our surveys sent out. The area surrounding our Airport Way box is not heavily populated, and is a large business community. There were fewer addresses to send the surveys out to within a half of a square mile around the box, compared to other areas.
								<br><br>

								This survey method only addresses population density of each neighborhood, and does not necessarily take other factors into account. For example, Airport Way has a high transient population of persons who inject drugs. Despite there being few homes and businesses to survey, the neighborhood may be utilizing the disposal box on a regular basis (due to their demographics). This is where our weekly data from the boxes themselves (number of sharps collected) comes into play. This survey report does not address these additional factors, and strictly focuses on public opinion.
							</p><br><br>

								<h3><strong> Response Rates: </strong></h3><br>
								<p>Figure 2 (below) shows the response rates from each neighborhood. Freeway Park had the highest percent of individuals and businesses in the area who responded to our survey, at 29%. Fremont Park was not far off, with 20% of residents and businesses responding. The lowest response rate came from Airport Way, at around 1% of individuals and businesses responding. All other neighborhoods fell between 5-12% response rate, which falls within the range of our overall response rate (8.62%).
