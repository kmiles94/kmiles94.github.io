                            "Floods affect more people worldwide than any other natural hazard. Flood risk results from the interplay of a range of processes. For river floods, these are the flood-triggering processes in the atmosphere, runoff generation in the catchment, flood waves traveling through the river network, possibly flood defense failure, and finally, inundation and damage processes in the flooded areas. In addition, ripple effects, such as regional or even global supply chain disruptions, may occur. Effective and efficient flood risk management requires understanding and quantifying the flood risk and its possible future developments. Hence, <em>risk analysis is a key element of flood risk management</em>. Risk assessments can be structured according to three questions: What can go wrong? How likely is it that it will happen? If it goes wrong, what are the consequences? Before answering these questions, the system boundaries, the processes to be included, and the detail of the analysis need to be carefully selected."

                                        Floods in Los Angeles are most common due to overflow of drainage basins or excessive rainfall. However, the risk of a flood causing damage to properties are low, and the risk of flood causing harm or injury to persons is even lower. Floods were more common in Los Angeles in the late 19th century into the early 20th century because of faulty infrastructure, however over the last 50 years major improvements have been made such as overflow basins, paved rivers and canals, and other means of catching and moving water through a system to prevent flooding. Vulnerabilities in the city for flooding are damage to foundation in housing but no real threat to the population. Los Angeles biggest threat fir natural disasters are earthquakes, as flooding has been management through man-made structures. 
                                        The city of Los Angeles has a flood control district that was created in 1915 after a disastrous flood destroyed property’s and claimed lives of residents. The Los Angeles Flood Control Act (ACT) was adopted by the State of California and is governed as a separate entity, by the County of Los Angeles Board of Supervisors (https://dpw.lacounty.gov/LACFCD/web/). The County of LA has divided the work among City Planners, Watershed Management Division, Public Works Flood Maintenance and Water Source Divisions, and a few other departments to maintain the prevention of floods. Drainage infrastructure, dams and reservoirs, open channel, underground storm drains, pump plants, debris basins, sediment placement sites, seawater intrusion barriers and catch basins are all maintained by the county to ensure floods are minimal.<br><br>
                                        Historically, flooding has occurred in Lancaster, Malibou Lake, Quartz Hill, Rowland Heights, and the San
                                        Gabriel and Santa Monica mountains. Properties in these areas are near steep hillsides where rainwater runs
                                        off quickly flooding areas along the hillside. Other properties are near a stream or lake where rainwater tends
                                        to run off quickly resulting in fl ooding of the adjacent areas.

I knew they would have great data, and throughout history has been a city, or region subject to flood. The three critical facilities I chose to include in my maps were Hospitals with Emergency Rooms, Emergency Disaster Offices, and also Primary Disaster Routes. In case of disaster, finding a health facility that can immediately attend to injury would be most suitable in an emergency situation. In case of evacuation, primary disaster routes would be helpful to vacate the city. And in the event of a flood, whether light or heavy, resources offered at emergency disaster offices will be most helpful to answering questions and providing services as they are equipped to do in these specific situations. These are the three types of facilities I would use in case of a disaster or emergency in relation to flooding. All the data for these facilities were available and accessible via Los Angeles Open Source GIS Data official website: http://geohub.lacity.org.</p>

                                      If worried about flood prevention in Los Angeles, I would suggest speaking to your local municipality about rain gardens, bio-retention planters, or permeable pavement facilities/surfaces. The majority of flooding comes from rainfall in Los Angeles City since the County has developed such a comprehensive plan of Flood Prevention. Finding a way to gather rainwater would be the most helpful to reducing the risk of flood in your area. Also, if you live in a neighborhood where you notice water build up after rainfall, it would be wise to contact your local municipality to alert them of excess water in streets and near homes to ensure that catch basins and other drainage features are working properly to collect and move the water. <br><br></center>

                                      <h2>Flood Insurance For Protection</h2><br>

                                        <p>
                                        Los Angeles County has been a NFIP participant since December 1980, making flood insurance
                                        available to all County unincorporated area residents. You can purchase a flood insurance policy
                                        from most insurance agencies. More than 25 percent of flood insurance claims occur outside of Special Flood Hazard Areas. Homeowner’s insurance rarely covers flood damage. In most cases, property owners must purchase flood insurance to protect against damage caused by flooding. Renters may also purchase flood insurace. The cost of your flood insurance policy will depend on factors that include, but are not limited to the type of property, level of flood risk, and amount of coverage selected. Coverage can also be purchased for the contents of the building. Elevation certificates may provide a discount on your flood insurance policy.
